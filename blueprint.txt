TO DO LIST & ARCHITECTURAL ROADMAP
================================================================================
[HUMAN-ONLY ACCESS: AI AGENTS ARE PROHIBITED FROM MODIFYING OR EDITING THIS BOX]
[THE FOLLOWING SECTION IS RESERVED FOR THE HUMAN ARCHITECT]

CRITICAL FUTURE UPDATES:
- The end goal for this code is to be on the iOS app store for free with premium upgrade features
- [ ] Phase 1: REFACTOR - Migrate "Hybrid Architecture" to 100% React. Eliminate Vanilla templates.js.
- [ ] Phase 1: INTEGRITY - Move logic to TypeScript (FireEngine.ts) to prevent currency-to-string math errors.
- [ ] Phase 1: STATE - Replace window.currentData with React Context/Zustand for true reactivity.
- [ ] Phase 2: PERFORMANCE - Offload Burndown simulation (70+ year loops) to a Web Worker.
- [ ] Phase 2: REVENUE - Add "Educational Needs" section in Budget for automated 529 drawdown tracking.

V4.5 COMPLETED LOGIC:
- [x] PERSONAS: Simplified to "HANDOUT HUNTER" and "IRON FIST". 
- [x] UI REORGANIZATION: Swapped SNAP (now middle) and Cash Safety Net (now right) cards.
- [x] UI: Moved Real Dollars toggle to the top header for better accessibility.
- [x] LOGIC: Clicking DWZ or Preservation Age cards auto-sets relevant parameters.
- [x] UI: Handout Hunter enables SNAP Target Floor; Iron Fist greys it out and disables it.
- [x] INSOLVENCY: Defined as <$1,000 total drawable liquid assets (including HELOC credit). Removed Shortfall.

PROJECT OVERVIEW: FIRECALC RETIREMENT ARCHITECT
================================================================================
FIRECalc is a high-fidelity decumulation engine designed for hyper-realistic 
retirement simulation. Unlike basic "mountain chart" calculators, FIRECalc 
solves for survival, tax liability, and government benefit eligibility in real-time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CORE FEATURE MODULES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  ASSET ARCHITECTURE: 
    Tracks liquidity (Cash, Taxable, Roth, 401k), illiquid equity (Real Estate, 
    Other Assets), and Private Equity (Stock Options/RSUs). Private equity 
    includes a dedicated growth solver and ordinary income tax treatment.

2.  INCOME STREAMS: 
    Dynamic W2/1099 modeling with automated 401k contribution caps, matching 
    logic, and bonus structures. Features a "Non-Taxable Until" field for 
    modeling foreign earned income exclusions or temporary tax holidays.

3.  BUDGET & SAVINGS: 
    Distinguishes between "Savings" (Inflows) and "Expenses" (Outflows). 
    Supports "Fixed" expenses (no inflation) and "Retirement Toggle" to 
    instantly model lifestyle changes (e.g., stopping daycare costs).

4.  BENEFIT OPTIMIZER: 
    Real-time ACA (Obamacare) and SNAP (Food Stamps) simulator. Models Medicaid 
    expansion gaps by state and recalculates household size based on child 
    birth years (aging out at 19).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE BURNDOWN ENGINE: DECUMULATION LOGIC
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The "Burndown" is a 10-pass iterative solver that determines the exact 
withdrawal required to satisfy the target budget while accounting for the 
"Tax Spiral" (withdrawals increase taxes, which require more withdrawals).

1.  THE WATERFALL: 
    Assets are drained according to a user-defined drag-and-drop priority list.

2.  SEPP / 72(t) LOGIC: 
    If a user retires before age 59.5, the engine calculates the maximum IRS-
    allowed penalty-free withdrawal (SEPP) based on life expectancy.

3.  SURVIVAL PASS (VULTURES PASS): 
    If strategic limits (like SEPP) fail to meet the budget, the engine 
    triggers an exhaustive pass that ignores all strategy to pull every 
    available liquid dollar until the budget is met or accounts hit $0.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BURNDOWN STRATEGY MODES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  HANDOUT HUNTER (Benefit Maximizer):
    - Target: Stay under 138% FPL (Federal Poverty Level).
    - Logic: Solves for a "MAGI Ceiling." It will attempt to pull as much as 
      possible from non-taxable assets (Cash, Roth) to keep taxable income 
      low enough to qualify for $0 premiums and max SNAP benefits.
    - Enables "SNAP Target Floor" slider to solve for specific aid amounts.

B.  IRON FIST (Strict Priority):
    - Target: Zero tax-optimization.
    - Logic: Follows the Draw Order waterfall blindly. It will exhaust the 
      first asset in the list entirely before moving to the second, 
      regardless of the tax consequence or benefit loss.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LOGIC TRACE & STATUS DEFINITIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Advanced Logic Trace provides a year-by-year "under the hood" look at the 
math, showing exactly how many dollars were pulled from which account and the 
resulting tax/health premium drag.

STATUS DEFINITIONS:
- PLATINUM (Green): Medicaid/Max Subsidy (<138% FPL).
- SILVER (Blue): High CSR Subsidy (138% - 250% FPL).
- MEDICARE (Slate): Age 65+ standard status.
- INSOLVENT (Red): TOTAL LIQUID DEPLETION. All drawable accounts (Cash, 
  Brokerage, Roth, 401k, HSA, Crypto, Metals, AND available HELOC credit) 
  are effectively $0 (<$1,000 total). Real Estate equity is not 
  considered solvent for daily bills.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE: SYNC & DOLLARS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  REAL vs NOMINAL: 
    Toggle between "Nominal Dollars" (face value in future years) and 
    "2026 Dollars" (purchasing power adjusted for inflation).

2.  GLOBAL SYNC: 
    Configuration keys (Current Age, Growth Rates, Inflation) are synced 
    globally via `GLOBAL_SYNC_KEYS`. Changing the market outlook in Config 
    instantly updates the Burndown and Projection models.

3.  PRECISION MATH: 
    The engine treats Real Estate appreciation and Mortgage principal paydown 
    as distinct logical flows, ensuring Net Worth reflects both debt 
    reduction and asset growth.
